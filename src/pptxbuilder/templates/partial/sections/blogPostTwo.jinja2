            <p>You are the epitome of multitasking.</p>
            <p>Perfecting pie charts while in a heated discussion with a stakeholder, as well as gesturing that it’s
            your colleague’s turn to make coffee - that’s just how you roll.</p>
            <p>But even you – a <i>habitual task-juggler</i> - sometimes need a little help.</p>
            <p>And you know that finding a way to automate one of the most time-consuming, mundane and error-prone
            tasks – <i>creating PowerPoint presentations</i> - would make your life a great deal easier.</p>
            <p>If you spend a good portion of your time working with data, then PowerPoint automation will be your
            secret weapon to significantly improving your workflow.</p>
            <p><i>Let us show you how.</i></p>


          	<h2 class="section-heading"><strong>1. It will save you time.</strong></h2>


              <p>How long does creating a meaningful, concise and visually-engaging presentation take?</p>

                  <p><i>Two days? A week? Two weeks?</i></p>
              <p>However long you spend on creating a presentation that you’re proud of – PPTX Builder is guaranteed to
                  reduce that time.</p>
              <p>Quick access to various data points, different data visualisation techniques and no manual charting -
                  that’s our recipe for success.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading"><strong>2. It will save you money.</strong></h2>

              <p>Businesses are continually looking for ways to improve workflow efficiency.</p>
              <p><i>Time is money</i> – and reducing overall operating costs is a key priority for success-driven
                  companies.</p>
              <p>By bringing PowerPoint creation to 21st century, PPTX Builder will help your business achieve lower
                  costs:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Cutting data analysis and charting time means needing less resources for these tasks;</li>
                  <li>This results in reduced overall cost – and more time to improve other areas of your business.</li>
              </ul>

			<h2 class="section-heading"><strong>3. Slice and dice data however you want.</strong></h2>

              <p>The beauty of PPTX Builder is that – while it takes the tedious part of the job off your hands – you
                  always remain in control.</p>
              <p>You decide exactly <i>which</i> variables to look at and <i>how</i> to slice and dice your data.</p>
              <p>Better yet - because PPTX Builder will create data visualisations fast, you can go through multiple
                  variations until you find a trend that’s worth exploring further, without wasting time on manual data
                  entry.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading"><strong> 4. Choose an appropriate chart type for your story.
</strong></h2>

              <p>Not only does PPTX Builder make the job of finding a meaningful story more streamlined – it also
                  allows you to quickly experiment with different types of data visualisation, helping you find the one
                  that works best to communicate the findings.</p>




            <h2 class="section-heading"><strong>5. Better quality - no human errors.
</strong></h2>

              <p>How many times have you panicked about an error (or two) sneaking into a presentation which you’ve
                  already shared with the <i>big shots</i>?</p>
              <p>Well, that won’t need to happen anymore.</p>
              <p>PPTX Builder pulls the data directly from your dataset, so you can forget having to desperately plead
                  your colleagues to be the ‘<i>second pair of eyes</i>’ after triple-checking the data yourself.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading"><strong> 6. Fulfil demanding client needs. </strong></h2>


              <p>Why do your clients choose you over your competitors?</p>
              <p>Most likely, because you give them what they’re after.</p>
              <p>You meet their needs. You help them stay informed and make them feel more confident in their job
                  roles.</p>
              <p>You help their company stand out – and make smart, informed business decisions.</p>
              <p>In a world where competition is fierce, and time is an increasingly precious asset, you need to go
                  above and beyond to ensure your clients’ demands are met and expectations are exceeded. PPTX Builder
                  will help you do that – quickly, and without errors.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading"><strong> 7. New deliverable = new revenue stream.</strong></h2>


              <p>If you don’t currently offer PowerPoint presentations to your clients – it’s about time to consider
                  doing so.</p>
              <p>Clients want to see a clear, concise and easy-to-grasp story – because having to endlessly navigate
                  through data tables is frustrating (and no-one has time for that).</p>
              <p>Offering PowerPoint presentations as an additional deliverable could create a new revenue stream –
                  especially if the creation of PowerPoint charts is automated.</p>
